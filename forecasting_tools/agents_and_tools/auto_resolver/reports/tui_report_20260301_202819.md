### Question 39056

**Title:** [PRACTICE] Will Shigeru Ishiba cease to be Prime Minister of Japan before September 2025?
**URL:** https://www.metaculus.com/questions/39056

**Question Contents:**

> [PRACTICE] Will Shigeru Ishiba cease to be Prime Minister of Japan before September 2025?

| Output Resolution | Correct Resolution |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| FALSE | CanceledResolution.ANNULLED |

**Cost:** $0.1234

**Key Evidence:**
- Ishiba announced his resignation on September 7, 2025, which is after the resolution cutoff of September 1, 2025.
- During July and August 2025, Ishiba actively denied resignation reports, calling them 'completely unfounded,' and stated he would focus on tariff negotiations with the U.S.
- The LDP performed poorly in the House of Councillors election on July 20, 2025, generating calls for resignation, but Ishiba resisted throughout July and August 2025.
- After completing U.S.-Japan trade deal negotiations in early September 2025, internal LDP pressure intensified, leading to his resignation announcement on September 7, 2025.
- Sanae Takaichi succeeded Ishiba and took office on approximately October 21, 2025, confirming Ishiba remained PM through at least September 7, 2025.

### Question 39621

**Title:** Will Sam Altman Use Microsoft Teams before 2026?
**URL:** https://www.metaculus.com/questions/39621

**Question Contents:**

> Will Sam Altman Use Microsoft Teams before 2026?

| Output Resolution | Correct Resolution |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| FALSE | CanceledResolution.ANNULLED |

**Cost:** $0.1739

**Key Evidence:**
- No news articles, official statements, or credible reports document Altman using Microsoft Teams across multiple searches.
- Sam Altman was fired from OpenAI on November 17, 2023, via a Google Meet call — not Microsoft Teams — which generated social media jokes about Teams being snubbed.
- Altman was hired by Microsoft on November 20, 2023, but returned to OpenAI as CEO just days later (November 21, 2023), before ever meaningfully starting his Microsoft role.
- Searches for 'Sam Altman' + 'Microsoft Teams' return only social media jokes and irony commentary about OpenAI using Google Meet instead, with zero credible reports of him actually using Teams.
- The original question appears to be asking a humorous/ironic question prompted by the Google Meet firing, and no resolution evidence (YES) has been documented.

| Output Resolution | Correct Resolution |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| TRUE | CanceledResolution.ANNULLED |

**Cost:** $0.1398

**Key Evidence:**
- A Track II dialogue was held in Shanghai, July 7–11, 2025, organized by Harvard Kennedy School's Project on Managing the Atom, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and China's Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, explicitly addressing nuclear risk reduction.
- The American Academy of Arts and Sciences officially acknowledged the engagement, publishing a winter 2026 bulletin article titled 'Opportunities and Challenges: U.S.-China Nuclear Arms Control and Risk Reduction.'
- The July 2025 Shanghai dialogue explicitly addressed nuclear risk reduction, strategic stability, nuclear forces and policies, no-first-use commitments, nonproliferation, and risk-reduction mechanisms.
- The Trump administration pursued a multilateral approach to nuclear arms control throughout 2025, engaging both Russia and China, with Trump discussing nuclear weapons reduction talks with China.
- China did not rule out bilateral nuclear risk reduction talks with the U.S., and a Trump-Xi meeting occurred in November 2025 in South Korea, which included broader diplomatic engagement.

**Question Contents:**

> In 2025, will IRA's Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credits (45Χ) start requiring the use of domestic materials or subcomponents?

| Output Resolution | Correct Resolution |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| TRUE | CanceledResolution.ANNULLED |

**Cost:** $0.1806

**Key Evidence:**
- The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (H.R. 1, Public Law 119-21) was signed into law on July 4, 2025 — before January 1, 2026
- The OBBBA introduced restrictions prohibiting 'material assistance from any prohibited foreign entity' for eligible components, effective for tax years beginning after July 4, 2025
- The OBBBA established a Material Assistance Cost Ratio (MACR) calculation framework that restricts foreign-sourced materials
- For tax years beginning after December 31, 2026, at least 65% of the direct material cost of an integrated component must come from primary components manufactured in the U.S.
- The resolution criteria fine print states 'Any requirement for domestic materials or subcomponents will resolve this question as Yes'

### Question 39600

**Title:** Will Maersk resume shipping in the Red Sea in 2025?
**URL:** https://www.metaculus.com/questions/39600

**Question Contents:**

> Will Maersk resume shipping in the Red Sea in 2025?

| Output Resolution | Correct Resolution |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| TRUE | CanceledResolution.AMBIGUOUS |

**Cost:** $0.0966

**Key Evidence:**
- On December 18–19, 2025, Maersk's vessel Maersk Sebarok successfully completed a transit through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Red Sea, marking the company's first container ship passage through the Red Sea since early 2024.
- Maersk confirmed the transit on December 22, 2025, via an official announcement on maersk.com, calling it 'a significant step forward.'
- This was part of Maersk's MECL service (Middle East Container Line) and represented a formal (if cautious) change to its routing policy.
- In early 2025, Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd through their Gemini Cooperation planned to route one shared IMX service through the Red Sea and Suez Canal, though by late February 2025 some sailings had to be rerouted back around the Cape of Good Hope.
- After the successful December transit, a subsequent transit by the U.S.-flagged Maersk Denver occurred in January 2026, and Maersk announced a 'structural return' of MECL to the trans-Suez route on January 15, 2026.

> Will real-money betting on Polymarket or Manifold become legal in the United States in 2025?

| Output Resolution | Correct Resolution |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| CanceledResolution.AMBIGUOUS | CanceledResolution.ANNULLED |

**Cost:** $0.2094

**Key Evidence:**
- The synced Metaculus question (post_id 31340, question_id 30969) resolved as Ambiguous on September 24, 2025, before Polymarket's December 2025 CFTC approval and US launch.
- The question explicitly states: 'This question will resolve to the same value as the synced question.'
- Polymarket's US beta launch occurred in December 2025 — after the synced Metaculus question had already closed/resolved.
- Manifold discontinued its real money 'sweepcash' feature on March 28, 2025, and did not pursue legalization in the US.
- A related but separate Metaculus question (question_id 39385, opened October 16, 2025) resolved as Annulled, further supporting ambiguity around this topic.

### Question 39580

**Title:** Will global average wealth per adult increase in 2024 compared to 2023?
**URL:** https://www.metaculus.com/questions/39580

**Question Contents:**

> Will global average wealth per adult increase in 2024 compared to 2023?

| Output Resolution | Correct Resolution |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| CanceledResolution.AMBIGUOUS | TRUE |

**Cost:** $0.3324

**Key Evidence:**
- UBS Global Wealth Report (2025): Global wealth grew 4.6% in 2024, following a 4.2% increase in 2023, with growth heavily concentrated in North America (+11%).
- Allianz Global Wealth Report 2025 confirms global net financial assets grew in 2024.
- WID/World Inequality Report data shows global wealth-income ratios rose to over 625% of world net domestic product by 2025, continuing upward trends.
- No direct confirmation was found of the specific WID metric `anweal_p0p100_z` values for 2023 and 2024 in search results.
- More than half of the 56 markets sampled by UBS did not participate in global wealth growth in 2024 and actually saw their average wealth per adult decline in USD real terms, which could affect the median differently from the mean.

**Question Contents:**

> Will a federal court rule that the Trump administration violated the Impoundment Control Act in attempting to permanently withhold or cancel congressionally allocated funds by September 27, 2025?

| Output Resolution | Correct Resolution |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| FALSE | FALSE |

**Cost:** $0.2257

**Key Evidence:**
- All federal court rulings related to the Trump administration's impoundment of funds before the deadline were preliminary in nature (TROs or preliminary injunctions), which the resolution criteria explicitly excludes.
- On August 13, 2025, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that humanitarian groups lacked standing (only the U.S. Comptroller General could challenge an impoundment under the ICA) — a procedural ruling, not a violation finding.
- On September 26, 2025, the Supreme Court stayed Judge Ali's August order, allowing the Trump administration to withhold ~$4 billion in foreign aid, and explicitly stated this was not a final determination on the merits.
- The GAO issued findings on July 23, 2025 that the Trump administration violated the ICA by withholding Head Start program funds and Renew America's Schools Program funds, but the GAO is a legislative branch agency — not a federal court — so these findings do not satisfy the resolution criteria.
- Judge Ali's August 2025 expanded preliminary injunction found the freeze 'likely violated both federal law and the Constitution,' but this was still a preliminary ruling and does not qualify as a formal decision on the merits.

### Question 39359

**Title:** Will 2025 be the warmest year on record globally, according to the ECMWF?
**URL:** https://www.metaculus.com/questions/39359

**Question Contents:**

> Will 2025 be the warmest year on record globally, according to the ECMWF?

| Output Resolution | Correct Resolution |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| FALSE | FALSE |

**Cost:** $0.0527

**Key Evidence:**
- 2025 was the third-warmest year on record according to ECMWF, NOT the warmest.
- 2025 global surface air temperatures were 1.47°C above pre-industrial levels (1850–1900).
- 2025 was 0.01°C cooler than 2023 and 0.13°C cooler than 2024, with 2024 remaining the hottest year on record.
- ECMWF published this finding at: https://www.ecmwf.int/en/about/media-centre/news/2025/2025-third-warmest-year
- NOAA also confirmed 2025 as the third-warmest year globally.

**URL:** https://www.metaculus.com/questions/39381

**Question Contents:**

> In 2025, will the domestic content requirements become mandatory for obtaining the IRA's Investment Tax Credits (48Ε)?

| Output Resolution | Correct Resolution |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| FALSE | FALSE |

**Cost:** $0.2685

**Key Evidence:**
- The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) was signed into law on July 4, 2025, which is before January 1, 2026, but did NOT make domestic content mandatory for all 48E ITC claimants.
- For standard taxpayers claiming the ITC, domestic content compliance remains voluntary/optional, and meeting the requirements simply unlocks a bonus credit (10 or 2 percentage points).
- For direct pay ('applicable') entities (tax-exempt orgs, state/local governments, tribal governments, rural cooperatives), there are mandatory domestic content requirements or 'haircut' provisions, but this was already the case under the original IRA for projects ≥1 MW.
- The resolution criteria's fine print states: 'The domestic requirements becoming mandatory for ITC only for specific categories of projects will not resolve this question.'
- No legislation enacted before January 1, 2026 converted domestic content requirements into a universal eligibility prerequisite for the 48E ITC for all taxpayers.

**Question Contents:**

> Will Russia have significantly expanded its controlled territory in Ukraine on January 1, 2026?

| Output Resolution | Correct Resolution |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| FALSE | FALSE |

**Cost:** $0.1845

**Key Evidence:**
- All five 'must control all' locations remain under Russian de facto control as of January 1, 2026 (Simferopol, Nova Kakhovka, Svatove, Donetsk, Tokmak).
- Kharkiv: Russian forces were operating in northern Kharkiv Oblast but did not control the city as of January 2026.
- Zaporizhzhia: Russian forces advanced ~18 km south of the city but did not control the city.
- Sumy: Russian forces captured small border villages near Sumy Oblast but did not control the city.
- Odesa, Mykolaiv, Lozova, and Chernihiv showed no evidence of Russian control.

### Question 39389

**Title:** Will at least 500,000 Palestinians be displaced from Gaza before December 31st, 2025?
**URL:** https://www.metaculus.com/questions/39389

**Question Contents:**

> Will at least 500,000 Palestinians be displaced from Gaza before December 31st, 2025?

| Output Resolution | Correct Resolution |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| FALSE | FALSE |

**Cost:** $0.2153

**Key Evidence:**
- According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, approximately 100,000 Palestinians were forced to leave Gaza (cross the border entirely) since October 2023.
- Estimates of ~110,000 Palestinians fled to Egypt as refugees/asylum seekers.
- The Rafah crossing was largely closed after Israel occupied the Palestinian side in May 2024, severely limiting departures after that point.
- ~1.9 million Palestinians were internally displaced within Gaza, but this is movement within Gaza and does not count toward the threshold.
- The Gaza population declined by ~254,000 people (10.6%) by end of 2025, reflecting deaths, emigration, and other factors combined — far short of indicating 500,000 external departures.

**URL:** https://www.metaculus.com/questions/39406

**Question Contents:**

> At the end of 2025, will any of GiveWell's top charities perform mass deworming as their primary intervention?

| Output Resolution | Correct Resolution |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| FALSE | FALSE |

**Cost:** $0.3005

**Key Evidence:**
- GiveWell's four top charities as of January 1, 2026 are: Against Malaria Foundation (insecticide-treated nets), Malaria Consortium (seasonal malaria chemoprevention), Helen Keller International (vitamin A supplementation), and New Incentives (conditional cash transfers for vaccinations in Nigeria).
- Evidence Action's Deworm the World Initiative was previously a GiveWell top charity, but is no longer; GiveWell does not accept donations designated for this charity.
- Sightsavers receives GiveWell exit funding through ~March 2027 for deworming, but is not a top charity.
- The alternative resolution path (10% of regrants going to deworming) does not apply because GiveWell still maintains a top charities list; even if it did apply, deworming grants appear to be well under 10% of GiveWell's total 2025 grantmaking of $418M.
- None of GiveWell's four top charities perform mass deworming as their primary intervention.

**URL:** https://www.metaculus.com/questions/39421

**Question Contents:**

> Will the number of UFO sightings reported by the National UFO Reporting Center exceed 350 for September 2025?

| Output Resolution | Correct Resolution |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| FALSE | FALSE |

**Cost:** $0.1118

**Key Evidence:**
- September 2025 had 337 UFO sightings reported to NUFORC — well below the 350 threshold required for a 'Yes' resolution.
- The resolution criteria requires greater than 350 UFO/UAP sighting reports for September 2025.
- For comparison, August 2025 just barely exceeded 350 with 351 reports, while September fell short.
- The data is sourced directly from the NUFORC national event index (nuforc.org/ndx/?id=event), which is the exact source specified in the resolution criteria.
- October 2025 had 415 reports and July 2025 had 381, showing September 2025's 337 was notably lower than surrounding months.

**Question Contents:**

> Will Boeing file for bankruptcy before January 1, 2026?

| Output Resolution | Correct Resolution |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| FALSE | FALSE |

**Cost:** $0.0528

**Key Evidence:**
- Boeing has not filed for bankruptcy at any point in 2024 or 2025 and continues to operate as a going concern.
- Boeing faced significant headwinds including the 2024 machinists' strike (which cost ~$5 billion), a 737 MAX door plug blowout incident in January 2024, production delays, FAA restrictions, and mounting debt, but no filing occurred.
- Boeing continued reporting financial results through Q4 2025 and completed acquisitions (Spirit AeroSystems) and strategic divestitures in 2025.
- CEO Kelly Ortberg stated the company 'made significant progress on our recovery in 2025.'
- Boeing's consolidated debt stands at ~$54.1 billion as of end of 2025 — heavy, but being managed.

| Output Resolution | Correct Resolution |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| FALSE | FALSE |

**Cost:** $0.1168

**Key Evidence:**
- Resolution Threshold: $93,429.20 (Bitcoin's price at the start of 2025)
- December 31, 2025 Closing Price: Approximately $87,500–$88,430 — below the threshold
- CoinMarketCap data indicates a closing price of ~$88,430 on December 31, 2025
- StatMuse data corroborates a closing price of ~$87,502 on December 31, 2025
- Bitcoin fell approximately 19.1% from September 1 to December 31, 2025, resulting in a year-end price well below the starting price

**Question Contents:**

> Will ARC find that GPT-5 has autonomous replication capabilities?

| Output Resolution | Correct Resolution |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| FALSE | FALSE |

**Cost:** $0.2907

**Key Evidence:**
- METR (the successor to ARC Evals) evaluated GPT-5 and concluded GPT-5 is NOT capable of autonomous replication and does not pose catastrophic risks via rogue replication threat models.
- GPT-5's 50%-time horizon was measured at 2 hours 17 minutes, far below the concerning threshold of ~40 hours, with even upper-bound uncertainty estimates (~4.5 hours) well below what would trigger concern.
- GPT-5 was released on August 7, 2025, satisfying the timeline requirement for the question.
- There is no evidence that ARC (the original organization) published any evaluation of GPT-5 specifically; the evaluation work has entirely migrated to METR.
- No evaluation from either ARC or METR found GPT-5 to be capable of autonomous replication, making a Yes/TRUE resolution unsupported by current evidence.

**Cost:** $0.1607

**Key Evidence:**
- Flight 10 launched on August 26, 2025 at 23:30 UTC — clearly within H2 2025
- Flight 11 launched on October 13, 2025 at 23:23 UTC — clearly within H2 2025
- Flight 12 did NOT launch in H2 2025 — it is targeted for March 2026
- No other Starship launches occurred between July 1 and December 31, 2025
- Only 2 Starship launches occurred in the second half of 2025; the threshold of 3 or more launches was NOT met

**Question Contents:**

> Will the number of deaths from antibiotic-resistant infections per year double by December 31, 2025?

| Output Resolution | Correct Resolution |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| FALSE | FALSE |

**Cost:** $0.1773

**Key Evidence:**
- 2019 CDC Threats Report: ~35,000 deaths/year (the most comprehensive and most cited figure); ~48,000 when C. difficile is included
- 2013 CDC Report: ~23,000 deaths/year from antibiotic-resistant infections in the US (later revised upward to ~44,000 using improved methodology)
- July 2024 CDC update (2021-2022 data): Documented a 20% rise in hospital-onset infections, but did not provide a new comprehensive national death toll
- 2025 CDC report on NDM-CRE: Documented a 460% surge in one specific pathogen between 2019-2023, but this is not a comprehensive mortality estimate
- No report found — from the CDC or any other credible source — citing 70,000 or more annual US deaths from antibiotic-resistant infections, at any point through 2025

> Will 1 Euro be worth less than 1 US Dollar before 2026?

| Output Resolution | Correct Resolution |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| FALSE | FALSE |

**Cost:** $0.1372

**Key Evidence:**
- The lowest EUR/USD rate in 2024 was 1.0350, recorded on December 31, 2024. The euro never fell to or below parity (1.0000) during 2024.
- The lowest EUR/USD rate in January 2025 was 1.0257, recorded on January 10, 2025. This was the weakest point of 2025 and still remained above parity.
- After the January 2025 low, the EUR/USD rate recovered significantly throughout 2025, reaching approximately 1.13–1.17 range by late 2025, ending the year around 1.1714.
- While analysts in early 2025 warned parity was possible, it never materialized. The floor was approximately 1.0257.
- At no point during the January 1, 2024 – January 1, 2026 window did the EUR/USD exchange rate fall below 1.0000.

**Question Contents:**

> Will Walmart stores in the United States return to 24-hour service before 2026?

| Output Resolution | Correct Resolution |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| FALSE | FALSE |

**Cost:** $0.1970

**Key Evidence:**
- Most Walmart locations in the U.S. continued to operate on limited hours (typically 6:00 a.m. to midnight or similar schedules), rather than around the clock, as of January 2026.
- In August 2022, Walmart stated it had no plans to return to 24/7 operations, citing labor shortages, and no subsequent announcements reversed this policy through the resolution date.
- On December 24, 2025, Walmart stores operated only from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., and all 4,600+ U.S. Walmart stores were completely closed on December 25, 2025.
- No official announcement or credible reporting confirmed a return to majority 24/7 operations as of January 2026.
- Store hours remained limited (not 24/7) throughout 2024 and 2025, with staffing shortages and higher operational costs cited as reasons for maintaining limited hours.

**Question Contents:**

> Will Ukraine launch a nuclear weapons program before 2026?

| Output Resolution | Correct Resolution |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| FALSE | FALSE |

**Cost:** $0.1384

**Key Evidence:**
- Ukraine's Foreign Ministry repeatedly reaffirmed its commitment to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and stated it does not intend to acquire nuclear weapons.
- President Zelensky stated in February 2026: 'Unfortunately, there are no nuclear weapons in Ukraine.'
- The IAEA maintained continuous monitoring at Ukraine's nuclear sites throughout 2025, with no findings of weapons-related activities.
- All highly enriched uranium was removed from Ukraine by 2012, and IAEA safeguards remain in place at all Ukrainian nuclear sites.
- Statements about Ukraine's nuclear capability (e.g., a Ukrainian think tank in November 2024 and a 2024 Ministry of Defence report) referred to technical capability assessments, not an active program.

### Question 39489

**Title:** In 2025, will the domestic content requirements become mandatory for obtaining the IRA's Production 
**URL:** https://www.metaculus.com/questions/39489

**Question Contents:**

> In 2025, will the domestic content requirements become mandatory for obtaining the IRA's Production Tax Credits (45Y)?

| Output Resolution | Correct Resolution |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| FALSE | FALSE |

**Cost:** $0.2259

**Key Evidence:**
- The domestic content bonus under Section 45Y is optional, not mandatory — meeting the domestic content thresholds entitles taxpayers to a bonus credit of up to 10% on top of the base credit, but taxpayers can still claim the base 45Y credit without meeting domestic content requirements.
- The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBA) was signed into law on July 4, 2025, which is before January 1, 2026, but it did NOT make domestic content requirements mandatory for claiming the base 45Y credit.
- The OBBA introduced separate FEOC (Foreign Entity of Concern) restrictions, which are mandatory exclusions, but these are distinct from the existing IRA domestic content bonus credit requirements.
- The OBBA also terminated the 45Y credit for wind and solar projects placed in service after December 31, 2027, but kept domestic content as optional bonus credits.
- No other legislation enacted before January 1, 2026 made domestic content requirements mandatory for 45Y credits.

**Key Evidence:**
- China's only confirmed overseas military base is in Djibouti (operational since 2017), and Djibouti is not a BRICS member.
- Pentagon's 2024 Annual China Report (December 2024) states China 'probably has considered' various countries for PLA military logistics facilities — language of planning/consideration, not confirmation.
- Pentagon's 2025 Annual China Report (December 2025) lists Pakistan, Bangladesh, Cuba, Angola, Indonesia, and others as countries where China has 'likely also considered basing' — again not confirmation of operational bases.
- UAE was assessed by US intelligence as a suspected location (~2020-2022), but no confirmed operational base was established, and construction was reportedly halted.
- No BRICS member countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, UAE, Saudi Arabia) have a confirmed Chinese military base per any official public announcement.

**Question Contents:**

> Will Israel establish direct governmental control of the Gaza Strip in 2025?

| Output Resolution | Correct Resolution |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| FALSE | FALSE |

**Cost:** $0.1359

**Key Evidence:**
- Israeli military control expanded to approximately 75% of Gaza by mid-2025, but this was de facto military control — which explicitly does not count per the resolution criteria.
- A Gaza peace plan signed on October 9, 2025 established a National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG) — 15 Palestinian technocrats, not Israelis — headed by Ali Shaath, a former Palestinian Authority deputy minister.
- Israel did not formally annex any part of the Gaza Strip in 2025; annexation debates focused on the West Bank, not Gaza.
- While Defense Minister Israel Katz proposed military settlements in Gaza for 'security needs' in December 2024, this was never formally enacted as law or policy during 2025.
- No formal civilian government headed by Israelis was established over 50% or more of the Gaza Strip during 2025.

| Output Resolution | Correct Resolution |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| FALSE | FALSE |

**Cost:** $0.0963

**Key Evidence:**
- The most recent H5N1 IRAT assessment before the deadline was for A/Texas/37/2024, assessed in June 2024, which received an emergence score of 5.79 — well within the moderate risk category (4.0–7.9).
- In March 2025, two new clade 2.3.4.4b viruses were assessed: A/California/147/2024 (emergence score of 5.59) and A/Washington/239/2024 (emergence score of 5.21) — lower than the Texas virus and still in the moderate risk category.
- The highest emergence score ever recorded by the IRAT is 7.50 for an H1N1 swine flu strain (A/swine/Shandong/1207/2016). No influenza virus of any type has ever received a score ≥ 8.0 on IRAT.
- No H5 virus has ever approached the 8.0 threshold, let alone exceeded it.

**Key Evidence:**
- As recently as February 24, 2026, Moraes was presiding over the trial of suspects in the Marielle Franco killing, confirming he remains a sitting justice.
- U.S. Magnitsky Act sanctions were imposed in late July 2025, but Moraes publicly declared he would ignore the sanctions and remain in his position — which he did.
- While political groups called for his removal and Elon Musk publicly criticized him, no formal impeachment proceeded to completion.
- Supreme Federal Court justices in Brazil are appointed for life with mandatory retirement at 75; Moraes is 55, far from mandatory retirement.
- There is no evidence whatsoever that Alexandre de Moraes ceased to be a minister of Brazil's Supreme Federal Court before the resolution cutoff date of January 1, 2026.

| Output Resolution | Correct Resolution |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| FALSE | FALSE |

**Cost:** $0.0570

**Key Evidence:**
- A proposed constitutional amendment (PEC 8/2025) to eliminate the 6x1 work schedule has advanced through Brazil's legislature, but has not been enacted into law.
- By late 2025, the Senate's Constitution and Justice Committee had approved the amendment proposal — but committee-level approval is not the same as the full legislative enactment required for it to become law.
- The Federal Government publicly declared support for ending the 6x1 model, but verbal/executive support does not constitute an official ban.
- As of early 2026, the legislative timeline projects admissibility analysis completion at end of March 2026, with a potential Chamber of Deputies vote in May 2026.
- Some Brazilian companies have voluntarily transitioned away from the 6x1 schedule, but this is not a legal ban.

| FALSE | FALSE |

**Cost:** $0.2524

**Key Evidence:**
- None of the Magnificent Seven stocks came close to falling 50% below their all-time high during the resolution window (before January 1, 2026).
- The largest declines from ATH were in Microsoft (~29%) and Tesla (~19.5%), still well short of the 50% threshold.
- Most all-time highs for these stocks were set during 2025 — meaning prices were generally rising, not collapsing.
- Some all-time highs were set in late 2025 or early 2026 (e.g., Alphabet's ATH on February 3, 2026), confirming prices were still near historic highs rather than crashing.
- The question's resolution window (before January 1, 2026) has already passed, and there is no evidence that any of these stocks fell 50% from their all-time highs during that period.

- U.S. Intelligence Assessment (May 2025): 'Iran almost certainly is not producing nuclear weapons, but Iran has undertaken activities in recent years that better position it to produce them, if it chooses to do so.'
- Arms Control Association fact sheet confirms Iran is NOT a nuclear-weapons state, noting it can produce weapons-grade uranium for multiple bombs within weeks, but has not done so.
- Iran possessed ~972 lbs of 60%-enriched uranium as of mid-June 2025, but never enriched to weapons grade.
- Iran continues to officially deny any intention to develop nuclear weapons, insisting its program is entirely peaceful.
- There is no evidence that Iran announced possession of, or conducted a test of, a nuclear weapon at any point before 2026.

**Key Evidence:**
- All searches confirm there was no formal US offer, agreement, or deal with India regarding nuclear-powered submarines during the resolution period (January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2026).
- The US has consistently maintained that American domestic laws prevent sharing nuclear submarine propulsion technology with any nation outside formal treaty relationships — including India, despite the 2008 US-India Civil Nuclear Agreement.
- The AUKUS nuclear submarine agreement (US, UK, Australia) was not extended to include India. India is not part of AUKUS and no comparable arrangement was offered to India.
- India sealed a deal to lease a nuclear-powered Akula-class submarine (Chakra-III) from Russia in December 2025, not from the US.
- The Modi-Trump joint statement (February 13, 2025) focused exclusively on civil nuclear energy cooperation (reactors), not military/submarine nuclear technology.

| Output Resolution | Correct Resolution |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| FALSE | FALSE |

**Cost:** $0.2222

**Key Evidence:**
- The Chemical Geology paper (September 2024) by Avi Loeb and the Galileo Project involved four independent laboratories (Harvard, UC Berkeley, Bruker Corporation, and University of Technology in Papua New Guinea), satisfying the ≥3 labs criterion, but did not conclude with 95% confidence that the material was non-terrestrial.
- An October 2024 paper in Research Notes of the AAS (Patricio Gallardo) concluded the spherules match coal ash contaminants, with meteoritic origin 'disfavored.'
- A November 2024 preprint (Desch & Jackson) showed iron isotope ratios align with terrestrial fractionation lines, concluding that 'an interstellar origin can be effectively ruled out.'
- Research published in 2024 found the seismic signal used to locate the crash site was likely caused by a truck on a nearby road, not the meteor, meaning the expedition may have searched 100+ miles from the actual impact zone.
- No peer-reviewed study concluded with 95% confidence that the recovered material reflects a technological origin — Loeb's speculations about technological origin were not formal conclusions of any peer-reviewed paper.

- 3M explicitly disclaimed bankruptcy intent in a formal SEC 8-K filing (August 29, 2023): '3M has no present intention to file a petition for relief under the Bankruptcy Code.'
- 3M settled the Combat Arms Earplug lawsuits for $6 billion (announced August 29, 2023), with ~$5.8 billion already paid out to veterans by May 2025.
- 3M remained financially healthy throughout this period: Full-year 2024 sales of $24.6 billion with $4.9 billion in adjusted free cash flow; full-year 2025 sales of $24.9 billion with adjusted EPS of $8.06.

- Martial law was originally declared on February 24, 2022, in response to the Russian invasion and has been extended systematically every 90 days.
- Sources include Ukrinform, Anadolu Agency, and NV Ukraine (English) confirming the extensions.
- Ukraine's constitution prohibits national elections while martial law is in effect, providing additional context for the ongoing extensions.
